Ariesu keyboard PCB and plate files.
A 45%ish ergo-keyboard.
Warning: This keyboard has an extremely weird layout.

----

The prototypes are in perfectly working condition.

There will not be a group-buy, however, all the PCB and case files are open-source
so feel free to order the parts yourself!

The PCB is the main part of this project, it's nothing fancy but it's something I'm
proud of. :^) (No backlits, sorry.)

Since the case files are stacked acrylic, it features a 0 degree typing angle, but
feel free to make a case for the PCB if you want something unique.

## Features (Very simple PCB) 
* Mini-B USB connection. (Yes, I know.)

* 51 keys.

* ATmega32U4

* MX-only no per key leds.

* No backlit leds.
